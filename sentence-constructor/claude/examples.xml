    Clues to Help You Translate:
    The word for "bear" is "oso." Since it's plural, you need to change the form appropriately.
    "Are" in this case refers to location, so think about which form of estar you need to use for plural subjects.
    "At the door" involves a location; "puerta" means "door." How would you say something is at a place?
    "Did you leave" is in past tense. What is the past tense of "dejar" in the tú form?
    "Out" in this sentence is best translated as "fuera."
